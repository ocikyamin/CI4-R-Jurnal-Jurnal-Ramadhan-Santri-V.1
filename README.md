## What is Jurnal Ramadhan Santri ?

Jurnal Ramadhan adalah jurnal harian untuk merekam dan mencatat segala peristiwa, jadwal, rencana, aktivitas, dan lain sebagainya. Tujuan utama dari jurnal ramadhan yaitu untuk mengorganisir segala kegiatan atau rutinitas santri berulang agar lebih produktif.


## Setup

Copy `env` to `.env` and tailor for your app, specifically the baseURL
and any database settings.

## Important Change with index.php

`index.php` is no longer in the root of the project! It has been moved inside the *public* folder,
for better security and separation of components.

This means that you should configure your web server to "point" to your project's *public* folder, and
not to the project root. A better practice would be to configure a virtual host to point there. A poor practice would be to point your web server to the project root and expect to enter *public/...*, as the rest of your logic and the
framework are exposed.

**Please** read the user guide for a better explanation of how CI4 works!
